        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Abraham Azanon. I am a student majoring in Global Studies at the University of Riverside, California. I am a first year honor student who is pursuing a career in the education field. My goal is to become an English teacher who will teach students in other countries. I plan to study abroad hence why I majored in Global Studies. Global Studies will prepare by allowing me to learn the language, culture, lifestyle, norms, and values of the countries I decide to focus on. 
<br><br>

        I am a strong supporter of philanthropy which is why I have been in organizations that promote philanthropy. One of my most prideful achievements is being a part of the Inland Empire Community Foundation. The Inland Empire Community Foundation allowed me to be able to immensely help the issues in my community. As a grant analyzer, I was able to analyze grants and decide which Inland Empire organization would benefit the community. Countless organizations were approved of grants by my team and I which led to the solving of numerous issues in the Inland communities. I was able to understand the true meaning of being a philanthropist. I plan to use my knowledge and experience in philanthropy to continue giving back to the Inland Empire community. I will do so by continuing to join or collaborate with organizations similar to such as the Inland Empire Community Foundation which is all about improving the Inland region. My career goal of becoming a teacher will also provide a pathway for me to help my region. For I will be able to teach the future generations of the importance of always giving and serving one's community. I am certain that through my teaching there will be a rise of young future leaders and philanthropists.  <br><br>

        Besides having experience in being a philanthropist, I also have experience in working with others. I have been a part of the Student Government, School Site Council, Key Club, Interact Club, and so much more. As listed earlier  I joined two other community school clubs known as Key Club and Interact Club. In Key Club, I was able to help clean the school, such as the football fields and lunch areas after school hours. I donated food supplies such as canned food, toilet paper, and turkeys for the month of November. I also promoted school spirit, and advocated for the development of the San Bernardino community. Similar to Key Club, in Interact Club, I coordinated festivals for elementary schools, unified students by working toward a common goal, and created a safe environment.  Through these clubs and organizations, I have been able to grow and prosper in areas that I once lacked in. 

I have employment experience as a crew member at a JC Penny retail store. My position was to tend to customer needs, promote products, communicate any issues, and to stock supplies. 

Through my experience in organizations, clubs, and employment, I have gained fundamental skills that will allow me to succeed in any path I decide to take in life.
